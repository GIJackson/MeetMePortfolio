# MeetMePortfolio

I expect my project to be a website that hosts various information about myself, such as how to contact me, my resumes, and my projects. To better showcase my skills, I want the website it's self to be interactable in such a way that potential employers can see my skills the moment they use the page. The meat of this project will be the initial interaction page I want visitors to land on before they go to look at more info about me.

What work I need to do includes, but is not limited to: -Develop or copy a regex that identifies dates that could be misinterpreted i.e. 6/9/2023 could also be 9/6/2023 when read as purely numbers. -Develop a script (like a play script) to follow as the interactable portion of my website. For example, a picture of me pops up and asks for the user's name, and if the person gives obviously not a name, responds accordingly. -Understand a utilize API to pull real time information about the weather and air quality, as it's important for my comfort due to my severe allergies.

Project Features

* Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it

* Analyze text and display useful information about it. (e.g. word/character count in an input field)

* Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.

* Convert user input between two formats and display the result. (e.g. Fahrenheit to Celcius, kilograms to pounds, etc)
